# 7. Website Content Strategy

This document outlines the content strategy for the QuizzyAI public-facing website. The goal is to attract, inform, and convert visitors into registered users and customers.

## Connecting the Website to the Apps

The website will be the primary entry point for new users. It must be seamlessly connected to the web and mobile applications.

*   **Calls to Action (CTAs):** Prominent buttons for "Sign Up" (leading to the web app's registration page) and "Download the App" (linking to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store).
*   **Shared Branding:** The website will use the same design system (colors, fonts, logos) as the applications for a consistent brand experience.

## Key Pages

### 1. Homepage

The homepage is our digital storefront. It needs to be compelling and clear.

*   **Hero Section:**
    *   **Headline:** "Unlock Your Learning Potential with AI."
    *   **Sub-headline:** "Personalized quizzes, interactive courses, and a smart study companion. All in one place."
    *   **Visual:** An engaging animation or image showing the app in action on both a laptop and a mobile device.
